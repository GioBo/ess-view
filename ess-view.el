;;; Commentary:


;; When working with big R dataframes, the console is impractical for looking at
;; its content; a spreadsheet software is a much more convenient tool for this task.
;; This package allows users to have a look at R dataframes in an external
;; spreadsheet software.

;; If you simply want to have a look at a dataframe simply hit (inside a buffer running
;; an R process)

;; C-x w

;; and you will be asked for the name of the object (dataframe) to
;; view... it's a simple as that!

;; If you would like to modify the dataframe within the spreadsheet
;; software and then have the modified version loaded back in the
;; original R dataframe, use:

;; C-x q

;; When you've finished modifying the dataset, save the file (depending
;; on the spreadsheet software you use, you may be asked if you want to
;; save the file as a csv file and/or you want to overwrite the original
;; file: the answer to both question is yes) and the file content will be
;; saved in the original R dataframe.


;; If these functions are called with the prefix argument 0, then the dataframes
;; will be exported with their row.names, eg. use:

;; C-u 0 C-x w  (to see the object)

;; C-u 0 C-x q  (to see it and then have it saved back in the R dataframe)
